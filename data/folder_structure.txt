The captions have already been tokenized.  Each line represents a
caption, and consists of a caption ID and the actual caption.  Caption
IDs are <image file name>#<caption number>.  Any captions whose IDs
share an image file name describe the same image.  As far as we are
aware, all of the images are distinct.
